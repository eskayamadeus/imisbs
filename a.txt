im trying to fix the logout error, 
as well as strip the code down to its bare minimum, removing all the unnecessary stuff

okay so, when admin is logged in, the other users shouldn't login too


OBSERVATIONS (MARK ++ for completed tasks)
pupil can log in. It redirects to pupil/home
when pupil tries to logout, he's redirected to ibs.test. but if you use the back arrow to return, pupil is still logged in. CHECK LOGOUT
remember me and forgot your password are not configured.
Staff can login, and it redirects to staff/home
Staff profile icon button does not pop up a menu
Staff cannot logout. (MethodNotAllowedHttpException)
Parent can login. Redirects to pupilparent/home
Pupilparent can logout, but back arrow shows still logged in
Visitor can login, redirects to visitor/home
User sessions do not die at all. Going back several times reveals so many active users.
there is a different set of login pages for each individual user type, and it's extremely unnecessary
register page doesn't let you choose your role
trying to login as admin through ibs.test/admin throws a 419, session expired on the first attempt. Possible CSRF problem?
the 419 page generated when trying to login as admin gives a button which sends us back to ibs.test rather than ibs.test/admin
The URL which appears at the 419 page is ibs.test/admin/login instead of ibs.test/admin
Admin cannot logout. (MethodNotAllowedHttpException) 
Admin logout error - GET and POST fields are empty

-------------------------------------
updates: 
- admin, pupil can logout. pressing back button shows the exact page they accessed before logging out. but when you refresh, you find they're indeed logged out.fix this
- remove all vue from the app
- include on all pages:
	<!-- CSRF Token -->
    	<meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">
- removed forgot your password feature. if required, restore it, by creating a dummy project and finding out how it was used
